pageContent: '<p>Hidden deep within the forest in Cornbury Park is a secret. A camp, inhabited by gods, spirits and monsters; a sacred site that exists at the edge of midnight. Those lucky enough to enter are changed forever by what they experience within these rare and wondrous woods. You say the words, this secret belongs to you. Now you must share it, but who with? You know that this is the heart of the puzzle.</p><p>Spirit, human, monster, animal, demon. Every imaginable creature born of myth, fable and fairytale has been forced to retreat there. For in the very near future, this wilderness will be all that remains. One last forest, one last ritual. For in the forest at the edge of midnight, a new story waits to be born. Filled with power, love, anger and manifested from a great and extraordinary gathering. Where the creatures of myth and fairytale find strength in one another by accepting their place as fallen dreams. Your friends stand. Ready to follow you into the dark forest and to help you to change the fate of the last wilderness before midnight arrives. You have located the most precious and rarest of dreams, hidden within the minds of your friends, at this wild human gathering. Hope...</p><p>Now you must lead them to the other side of forever, beyond the border, deep within the forest, back to the camp before midnight arrives. Where a secret is hidden deep within the forest in Cornbury Park. A camp, inhabited by gods, spirits and monsters, a sacred site that exists at the edge of midnight. Where those who are lucky enough to enter are changed forever by what they experience within these rare and wondrous woods. Tick, tock, tick tock. Be you spirit or monster. God or mortal, you must stand with us, side by side, shoulder to shoulder, we shall face midnight together and give our story life.</p><div class="box box-medium"><p>"Immersive theatre at its best." &mdash; Sarah Stewart, Londonist</p><p>"Confusing and exhilarating in equal measure, the most intense theatrical event I&apos;ve attended this year!" &mdash; Londoneer</p><p>"A truly unique production.
